# Passwords hackeadas en ING

ING needs your help. Some hackers stole the passwords of the Database.
We have just 1 hour before the hackers erase all the data.

There are two kind of passwords: secures and unsecures.

According to security CoE, a secure password is the one will all the following properties:

It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.
For example:

ugknbfddgicrmopn is secure because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
aaa is secure because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
jchzalrnumimnmhp is unsecure because it has no double letter.
haegwjzuvuyypxyu is unsecure because it contains the string xy.
dvszwmarrgswjxmb is unsecure because it contains only one vowel.

There is an input file, int this folder, with all the passwords

How many passwords are secure?

There is a **zip** file [README2.zip](README2.zip) with the second part of instructions.
To unzip it, the password is in the line number that is equal to the number of
total secure passwords.

For simplicity, assume that line numbers starts at zero.
